This project showcases a comprehensive and interactive e-commerce analytics dashboard developed using Power BI to evaluate overall business performance in a clear and structured way. The dashboard highlights key performance indicators such as total revenue, total orders, average order value, freight value, and on-time delivery percentage to provide a quick business snapshot. It offers detailed insights into sales performance by analyzing revenue and order distribution across top product categories and customer states. Payment type analysis helps understand customer payment preferences and their impact on total revenue. The freight and logistics section focuses on total and average freight costs across different states and product categories, helping identify cost-intensive areas. Customer and delivery analysis examines delivery timelines, late deliveries, and their relationship with customer ratings. Monthly order trends reveal seasonal demand patterns and business growth over time. The distribution of customer ratings provides a clear view of overall customer satisfaction levels. State-wise delivery performance highlights regions with higher delivery delays and longer delivery times. Overall, this dashboard supports data-driven decision-making by combining sales, logistics, and customer insights into a single, easy-to-understand analytical solution suitable for business analysis and reporting.
